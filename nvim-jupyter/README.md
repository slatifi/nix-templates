# Neovim Jupyter Notebooks

This flake contains the Neovim configuration for Jupyter notebooks, which includes the following features:

- **Jupyter Kernel Management**: Automatically detects and manages Jupyter kernels.
- **Markdown Support**: Provides syntax highlighting and rendering for Markdown cells.
- **Code Execution**: Execute code cells and display output inline.

To run the configuration, execute the following command:

```bash
nix develop
```
This will open a bash shell with access to a Neovim environment that has the necessary dependencies installed.
